- handle if request value is not set for cpu and memory
  if the cpu and memory value is not set then the method getRequestValue in the scaling controller returns 0,0 for the cpu and mem value.
  This should be handled
- check the scaling conversion value
  eg: if we are passing 300.00 as a float32 value for cpu and mem is it going to be 300Mi and 300m which are accepted values.
- same point as above for limit too
